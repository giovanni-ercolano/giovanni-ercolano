### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Giovanni Ercolano and I'm a 20-year-old young man studying computer programming. 
In my spare time I devote myself to the development of various projects developed in different languages, 
in particular I have a strong interest in mobile.

Currently:

- ðŸ”­ I'm studying in the Software Architect program at ITS Academy Rizzoli in Milan.

- ðŸŒ± I'm focusing my studies on becoming a software engineer.

- ðŸ‘¯ I am interested in collaborating with anyone who is passionate about technology and in talking to other programmers.

- ðŸ’¬ I dream of working in a start-up, maybe even in the mobile field.
